## üìö Topics Covered

The content is structured to mirror the STAT2001 curriculum:

- **Probability Foundations**: Set theory, combinatorics, and Bayes' theorem.
- **Random Variables**: Discrete and continuous distributions, including moment-generating functions and correlation.
- **Multivariate Distributions**: Joint, marginal, and conditional distributions.
- **Sampling Distributions**: Understanding the central limit theorem and its applications.
- **Estimation Techniques**: Methods of moments and maximum likelihood estimation.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Formulating and testing statistical hypotheses.
- **Bayesian Statistics**: Introduction to Bayesian inference and estimators.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Resources

All examples and exercises are implemented using **R**, the primary statistical computing tool for this course. You'll also find:

- Interactive visualizations to aid understanding.
- Cheatsheets summarizing key formulas and concepts.
- Practice questions with step-by-step solutions.
